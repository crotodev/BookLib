&lt;h3&gt;Review&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I purchased this book for my classroom actually - my students are now getting to the age where they will start interviewing for positions in student organizations and internships, and I immediately saw that it was written in an easy-to-understand way. I am really glad I've purchased this because I think it's helped some of them enormously.&lt;br&gt;- Reader &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely informative and has simple tips for better conversation. Also talks about causes that are killing your conversations.&lt;br&gt;- Reader &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book, on the other hand, offers perspectives that make sense and can be truly acted upon. Some of my favorite sections were the chapter in which he explained how introverts can make a game of leading a conversation or when he outlined a 21 day plan to improve conversational skill.&lt;br&gt;- Reader &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part about this book is how there are key phrases and actions that we should engage in to better our conversations. &lt;br&gt;- Reader&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</dc:description>
