Cohn covers every facet of the transition: getting started, helping individuals transition to new roles, structuring teams, scaling up, working with a distributed team, and finally, implementing effective metrics and continuous improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout, Cohn presents “Things to Try Now” sections based on his most successful advice. Complementary “Objection” sections reproduce typical conversations with those resisting change and offer practical guidance for addressing their concerns. Coverage includes&lt;/p&gt;

I am so glad the book is finally out so I can stop saying, ‘Mike Cohn has a great new book coming out soon that will talk about this problem.’ Now I can say, ‘Mike’s book is out! Get it!’”&lt;/p&gt;

It combines great ideas with stories and examples from around the software industry and will appeal to a wide range of readers, from those looking to adopt a new company-wide agile process to developers who just need to improve the way a team is running a single project.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;strong&gt;Andrew Stellman&lt;/strong&gt; , Developer, Project Manager, and Author of &lt;em&gt;Head First PMP&lt;/em&gt; , &lt;em&gt;Beautiful Teams&lt;/em&gt; , &lt;em&gt;Applied Software Project Management&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;strong&gt;Michael Wollin&lt;/strong&gt; , Senior Development Manager, Broadcast Production Systems, CNN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mike Cohn has put together a fantastic book of guidelines to not only start the Scrum implementation, but to turn your entire corporation into an agile community. I have already implemented many of the recommendations included in this text and have seen a positive influence on the support for Scrum within our organization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;strong&gt;James Tischart&lt;/strong&gt; , CSM, CSP, CTFL, Vice President, Product Delivery, Mx Logic, Inc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In &lt;em&gt;Succeeding with Agile&lt;/em&gt; , Mike Cohn has scoured and sifted through the collective experience and lessons of not only scores of different projects, teams, and organizations from his own agile experience, but also from the experience of countless others. He provides real-world stories from the trenches, useful data and studies, and invaluable insights into what has and hasn’t worked well when adopting, adapting, and scaling Scrum. What I like best about the book is where Mike provides wisdom on several different alternatives and approaches and the circumstances in which each is most suitable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;strong&gt;Brad Appleton&lt;/strong&gt; , Internal Agile Consultant at a Fortune 100 telecommunications company&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I believe Mike Cohn’s book will answer many questions and issues that people and teams struggle with in terms of how to improve collaboration, communication, quality, and team productivity. I especially appreciate and agree with Mike’s statement that ‘there can be no end state in a process that calls for continuous improvement.’ This is hard work and it requires persistence, teamwork, and good people. I plan to make &lt;em&gt;Succeeding with Agile&lt;/em&gt; mandatory reading within my organization, just like we did with his book on &lt;em&gt;Agile Estimating and Planning&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;strong&gt;Scott Spencer&lt;/strong&gt; , Vice President Engineering, First American CoreLogic, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mike Cohn has done it again. This comprehensive study of agile software development provides numerous techniques and methodologies to achieve success. I enthusiastically recommend this book to anyone who wants to start using agile or wants to improve their software development process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;strong&gt;Benoit Houle&lt;/strong&gt; , Senior Development Manager, BioWare (a Division of Electronic Arts)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s no doubt that Mike Cohn’s new book will become the reference on how to run software projects with Scrum. The book is very carefully crafted and avoids the trap of giving you the one, simple recipe to all your problems. Though mainly centered on Scrum, Mike draws on various other techniques to produce a handbook that is thorough and complete. This is not a hasty mash-up supported by just an act of fa...&lt;/p&gt;
