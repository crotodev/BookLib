&lt;h3&gt;Product Description&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Laws of Charisma explores the vital skills and traits needed to earn trust, generate interest, and motivate others in the workplace. Bestselling author Kurt Mortensen defines the intersection of these pivotal abilities as charisma--an enviable quality that can lead to improved relationships, greater income, and more success in every area of life. To some extent, charisma is innate, but in this inspiring guide Mortensen explores the trait’s four core elements to show how anyone can draw out a more charismatic and compelling presence. With the help of practical tools, simple principles, applicable exercises, and insightful assessments, you’ll learn how to radiate confidence, passion, power, and optimism; influence others by improving communication skills; and persuade and empower anyone by creating instant rapport. People with the ability to enter a room and draw instant attention, effortlessly exuding charm and radiating energy, are better able to influence what gets done and ultimately achieve what they want. The Laws of Charisma is packed with everything you need to develop and bring out the more charismatic person within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;From Publishers Weekly&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people seem to be born with the ability to captivate, charm, influence, and inspire others. But certain skills and traits can be learned, says author Mortensen (Maximum Influence), and he outlines various principles to help readers increase their ability to succeed. While the book starts out strong, with an impassioned introduction, and the quick chapters are broken up into digestible bits, the work falls short. The tone is elementary, the format becomes somewhat repetitive, and many of the lessons in self-improvement are too basic: for example, Mortensen discusses how professional dress and titles can enhance one' s image and add to one' s authority, and stresses the importance of communication and presentation skills. For readers early in their careers or who are stuck in a rut, this work might offer a practical look at possible blind spots or perception biases and fundamental skills to work on. For bosses, the straightforward tips might provide a safe and constructive teaching tool. But for those who are trying to take their powers of persuasion to a higher level, the work may be too simplistic. &lt;br&gt;Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

&lt;h3&gt;Book Description&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people have the ability to enter a room and draw instant attention, effortlessly exuding charm, radiating energy and a commanding presence. That enviable quality is called charisma…and those who have it are better able to influence what gets done and ultimately achieve what they want. To some extent, it’s innate—but with a few simple principles anyone can develop a more charismatic and compelling presence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filled with practical, powerful tools, exercises, and assessments, &lt;em&gt;The Laws of Charisma&lt;/em&gt; explores the vital skills and traits anyone can use to earn trust, generate interest, and motivate others. Focusing on the four core elements of charisma, this book shows readers how to: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Radiate confidence, passion, power, and optimism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Combine purpose, creativity, competence, and focus to inspire commitment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Influence others by improving communication skills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Persuade and empower anyone by creating instant rapport. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;From the Inside Flap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s breathtaking to watch someone with charisma enter a room. The sound of their voice and their mere presence seem to have a captivating effect on everyone around them. It’s as if an invisible field of energy surrounds them, mesmerizing others like a magical spell.Your career, your relationships, and your income are all related to your ability to radiate this mysterious trait. But what is charisma? Is it something with which only a lucky charismatic few are born? Or is it something that can be learned? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much more than simply charm, likability, presence, or passion, charisma allows you to build rapport instantly, inspire others, and influence them to your way of thinking, all while putting them at ease. In &lt;em&gt;The Laws of Charisma&lt;/em&gt; , Kurt W. Mortensen, one of America’s leading authorities on persuasion and influence, reveals the specific skills, traits, and attributes associated with charisma that you can learn, develop, and master. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Emanate energy, conviction, and assurance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Energize everyone around you with your enthusiasm, passion, and expectations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Learn the eye contact and listening skills that will enable you to communicate effectively without speaking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Leverage self-discipline and willpower to get what you want effortlessly while riding a wave of goodwill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Gain people’s trust by creating powerful images through storytelling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Win contagious cooperation from even the unlikeliest of allies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Get others to not only want to do what you want them to do…but beg you to do it, like doing it, and tell all their friends that they should be doing it too! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each chapter of &lt;em&gt;The Laws of Charisma&lt;/em&gt; presents one of the thirty critical skills or traits essential to this enigmatic and powerful characteristic so often associated with those who are successful, well liked, and happy. The book provides both current and historical examples of how each component can be and has been used, how you can apply each one in your own life in any circumstance, and common blunders to watch out for. Mortensen also provides quotes that offer insight on each area of charisma, and in each chapter supplies you with a special Charisma Key that gives you something concrete that you can do and apply right away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;INTRODUCTION &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FABLE: THE ANGRY BEE &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long brutal winter, it finally happens—a beautiful warm &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;spring day. You go outside and feel the warmth of the sun on your &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;face and your body, and you take a whiff of the fresh air. You decide &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you are done with winter and want to let the warm spring air into &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;your home. You open all the doors and all the windows. You feel &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the fresh air rush in and revitalize and renew your home. Warm air &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;isn’t the only thing rushing into your home; you hear the buzz of &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;an insect. Out of the corner of your eye, you see a bee flying around &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;your home. The bee seems so helpless that you decide to help. You &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;want to show the bee the way to freedom. The bee keeps slamming &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;into and bouncing off the large pane window in your living room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You open up the front screen door and try to direct the bee with &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;your hands to safety and security. The more you try, the more irritated &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the bee gets. You’re puzzled at the bee’s anger. You think to &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yourself, ‘‘I’m only trying to save the bee’s life.’’ You finally try to &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;direct the bee from the window to the open door by using your &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;whole body. The bee gets angry and stings you on the arm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MEANING &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In life as you attempt to serve others, lead others, or influence others &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to do things that will help them grow, improve themselves, or &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;change their lives, you are attacked, criticized, or even ‘‘stung.’’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens? What goes wrong, and why do others sometimes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;refuse your help? Why do they reject your leadership or refuse to &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;be influenced by you? You have their best interest in mind. We &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;know their refusal hurts them more than it hurts you. We say it is &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their fault, they should be smarter—but it is our fault. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you get others to want to do what you want them to do &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and be excited to do it? Let’s find out and master the power of charisma, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;leadership, and influence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</dc:description>
