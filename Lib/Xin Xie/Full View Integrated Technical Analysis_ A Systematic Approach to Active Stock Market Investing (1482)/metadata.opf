&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A fresh approach to technical analysis utilizing a full view (multi-time frame) integrated analytical system.&lt;/strong&gt; Has the bear market ended? Is the rebound lasting? Everybody wants an answer but nobody can provide one with a good degree of confidence. While fundamental analysis is notoriously weak when it comes to market timing decisions and price target forecasts, technical analysis is equally timid in providing any concrete answers to the above fundamentally important questions for market participants. No existing system has produced a firm answer with a respectable degree of conviction. &lt;br&gt;This book will present a system to answer those questions with a high degree of confidence. &lt;br&gt;For concreteness, the stock market is used for the analyses and discussions in the book. But the methodologies and principles apply equally well to all financial markets, particularly the foreign exchange market, futures market and commodities market. Additionally, new insights are provided on the mutual fund industry. &lt;br&gt;Xin Xie is the Director for Institute of International Trade and Investment at the Upper Yangtze River Economic Research Center, Chongqing University of Business and Technology and PRC Ministry of Education. He has a PhD in Economics from Columbia University in New York and a Master of Arts Degree in Statistics at Zhongnan University of Finance in China. He has extensive experiences in banking and investment industries as Senior Economists and Strategists in Bank of America and UBS AG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Review&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The businessï¼ˆof technical analysis) is increasingly drawing talented people.&lt;br&gt;Xie looks at TA afresh in Full View Integrated Technical Analysis.&lt;br&gt;...worth for the aficionados of TA. --Money Life Magzine &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system aims to take all trends of durations into consideration, and to incorporate information about various aspects of the market dynamics from multiple indicators, .. according to market conditions.&lt;br&gt;--The Hindu Business Line &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art of putting integration into technical analysis. --China Daily&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Review&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xin Xie's work thoroughly explores the full-view analytical framework that encompasses technical analysis and clarifies it for technicians and fundamentalists alike.&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;em&gt;The Technical Analysis of STOCKS &amp;amp; COMMODITIES Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xin Xie's method is reminiscent of Krausz, Elder, and DeMark but taken to the next level. He's identified new price patterns that provide a fresh approach to trading and has put his ideas together in a thoroughly clear and systematic way. Traders and technical analysts should be delighted to take each component and find new ways to profit.&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;strong&gt;Perry J. Kaufman&lt;/strong&gt; , &lt;em&gt;Author of&lt;/em&gt; New Trading Systems and Methods, 4th Edition &lt;em&gt;(John Wiley 2005)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; A Short Course in Technical Trading &lt;em&gt;(John Wiley 2003)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wilder the international economic dislocations in financial markets, the higher is the interest in technical analysis. Xin Xie's excellent book starts where today's basic technical analysis ends and fails. The book takes a conceptually fresh approach which Xin Xie calls FVITA. He succeeds at addressing the two main shortcomings of technical analysis-fixed parameter values and a lack of communication between myriads of technical indicators-which must be overcome in order to more safely identify changes in trends, which is the most important goal of technical analysis. Xin Xie's highly sophisticated concept not only highlights the source of failures in existing technical analysis but shows that FVITA increases the robustness of forecasts by providing a systematic view of market dynamics and interferences, resulting in effectively linking fundamentals with technical analysis. Xin Xie's impressive expertise makes this book a must read for technical analysts who wish to acquire a more robust and faster tool set in identifying changes in important market trends which in our times often come with tectonic force. Technical analysis will never be the same after Xin Xie's brilliant book.&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;strong&gt;Alfred Signer, Dr. oec. HSG&lt;/strong&gt; , &lt;em&gt;Former Managing Director, Country Research and Risk Controlling, UBS AG&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;From the Author&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For concreteness, the stock market is used for presenting the analyses and discussions in the book. But the methodologies are tested and robust in other financial markets, particularly the foreign exchange market, futures market and commodities market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;From the Inside Flap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Full View Integrated Technical Analysis&lt;/em&gt; is a new approach for the experienced Technical Analyst. Xin Xie has created a system that provides a full picture of market moving forces and offers unabridged coverage of market dynamics, helping you to understand the overall working of the market, rather than just capture independent trading opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full View Integrated Technical Analysis includes techniques to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;precisely define trends with a clear specification of its effective range; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;robustly and efficiently differentiate a new trend from a temporary counter movement; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;forecast temporary rebound as well as the final bottom-up rebound from a market decline with a strong degree of confidence; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;understand where and why most conventional technical analyses fail, setting the stage for integrating the system with existing indicators for significantly improved performance; and &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;effectively integrate technical analysis with fundamental analyses. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Full View Integrated Technical Analysis&lt;/em&gt; Xin Xie takes another step forward towards harvesting the joint power of all the knowledge accumulated in market analyses. This is essential reading for all Technical Analysts who are looking for an integrated approach to their trading techniques. &lt;/p&gt;
