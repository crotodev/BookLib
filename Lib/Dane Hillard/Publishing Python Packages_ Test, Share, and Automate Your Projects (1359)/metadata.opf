&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Create masterful, maintainable Python packages! This book includes pro tips for design, automation, testing, deployment, and even release as an open source project! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Publishing Python Packages&lt;/em&gt; you will learn how to: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build extensions and console script commands&lt;br&gt;Use tox to automate packaging, installing, and testing&lt;br&gt;Build a continuous integration pipeline using GitHub Actions&lt;br&gt;Improve code quality and reduce manual review using black, mypy, and flake8&lt;br&gt;Create published documentation for your packages&lt;br&gt;Keep packages up to date with pyupgrade and Dependabot&lt;br&gt;Foster an open source community using GitHub features &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Publishing Python Packages&lt;/em&gt; teaches you how to easily share your Python code with your team and the outside world. Learn a repeatable and highly automated process for package maintenance that’s based on the best practices, tools, and standards of Python packaging. This book walks you through creating a complete package, including a C extension, and guides you all the way to publishing on the Python Package Index. Whether you’re entirely new to Python packaging or looking for optimal ways to maintain and scale your packages, this fast-paced and engaging guide is for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreword by David Beazley. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About the author&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dane Hillard&lt;/strong&gt; has spent the majority of his development career using Python to build web applications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Review&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;"...practical...I learned a lot from this book. A wholly modern approach to current packaging tooling and the problems faced by package developers...I think you'll find it to be a useful source and an inspiration." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;—From the foreword by David Beazley, author of&lt;/strong&gt; Python Distilled &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;"A comprehensive guide to the Python packaging landscape. Dane takes a complicated topic and makes you think, 'Yeah, I got this.' It's impressively done. Recommended." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;—Carlton Gibson, Django Project &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-style: italic"&gt;"A comprehensive guide for Python programmers ready to share their code with the world." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;—Joshua A. McAdams, Senior Software Engineer, Google&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;From the Author&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidance in this book represents a culmination of practices I've refined working with others on the maintenance of open source and proprietary Python packaging projects over the last few years. Whereas &lt;em&gt;Practices of the Python Pro&lt;/em&gt; was a rather philosophical book, this is decidedly on the practical end of the spectrum with informational passages and a progressive project using full-scale tooling to show you the ropes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that with the inclusion of such contemporary technologies as GitHub Actions and workhorse tools like tox and cibuildwheel, this book can offer something to anyone in the data science, scientific computing, web, and other fields who wants to get their package published on the Python Package Index all while making it fun and rewarding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was excited to work with Manning on this, my sophomore effort, and their attention to detail and teaching quality rewarded my decision to return. My hope is that the didactic review and technical editing, in addition to the early access program and typical book production processes, have created a polished piece for you to follow as smoothly start to finish as your time allows.&lt;/p&gt;
