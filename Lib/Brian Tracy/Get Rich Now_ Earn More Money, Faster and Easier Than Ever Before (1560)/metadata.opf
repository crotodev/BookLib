&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Would you like to become rich?&lt;/strong&gt; A great many books and articles have been written on money â€“ what it is, how to earn it, how to spend it, who has it and who does not, and a myriad of other topics related to the effects that it produces. Money is one of the most fascinating, thought provoking, emotional, polarizing, and well-researched subjects in the world. Yet, despite the constant focus on it, the average person's views about money and how best to become rich is confusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is so much disinformation that most people rely on chance for their wealth. That leaves a great deal of untapped human potential that is never realized. It's also totally unnecessary, because the way to create, invest, and spend money wisely is known and the methods have been proven again and again by people who are easily making a fortune. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In writing this book, Brian Tracy had one goal: to show you too can earn money faster and easier than ever before. If you simply study his ideas in this book and apply them to your life and your business, you too can get rich now. Learn how to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage spending and debt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate income&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate wealth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiply wealth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protect your wealth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
