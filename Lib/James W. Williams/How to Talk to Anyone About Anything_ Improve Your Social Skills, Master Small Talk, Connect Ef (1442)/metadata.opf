&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Great guide to good conversation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a great short guide that can help lead you to deeper and more meaningful connections. I really appreciated the chapter on listening, as we often don't do that well enough. It was a nice boost in self confidence by learning that charisma is crafted through practice and those people who excel at it, weren't just born gifted. It makes you feel optimistic about getting there someday!" - &lt;em&gt;Amazon Customer&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Great Little Comprehensive Book &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a great little comprehensive book. I say little because it is a quick read but it covers all the bases in helping you learn to open up and communicate with others, There are plenty of starters and also what Not Not To Do's for someone that might need that kind of guidance. The opening story about Kyle really sets the stage to learn that there are people out there that really need this guidance. I didn't think I did, but its always good to get more tips on how to communicate and relate to other people so even if you don't think you have problem, you could still garner some great pointers." - &lt;em&gt;Amazon Customer&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Good material &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Good presentation that leads the reader through clear steps of information. Includes important areas on listening, asking questions, and small talk. A useful guide." - &lt;em&gt;Amazon Customer&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Tongue-tied no more! &lt;/p&gt;

Williams is an easy to follow book full of tips and tricks that will help you start a conversation and carry a conversation as well as learn how to be more charismatic and confident, and much more." - &lt;em&gt;RoseyLovesBooks&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Great tips to talk with everyone &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Another great work By JW Williams... how to talk to anyone is full of great tips to establish relationships with people ( at least, for me). It helped to feel confident with myself because I'm now able to find a way to talk with those persons I love to contact in order to establish a connection...in business, in love etc." - &lt;em&gt;Amazon Customer&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight: bold"&gt;Actionable advice &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What a great read; easy to digest with actionable advice in each section. It made me realize that making small adjustments to my interactions with others can have big benefits." - &lt;em&gt;Amazon Customer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</dc:description>
