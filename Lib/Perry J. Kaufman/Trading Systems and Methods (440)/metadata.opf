&lt;h3&gt;From the Inside Flap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With recent advances in institutional trading strategies—most notably high-frequency trading and artificial intelligence—generating rewards against high-tech competition has seemed next to impossible. In this updated &lt;em&gt;Sixth Edition&lt;/em&gt; of the bestselling classic &lt;em&gt;Trading Systems and Methods&lt;/em&gt; , market guru Perry Kaufman provides investors with tools they can use to make large gains, even in today's complex markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For nearly three decades, &lt;em&gt;Trading Systems and Methods&lt;/em&gt; has provided investors with basic knowledge (starting with an introduction to technical analysis, statistics, and market charting) and detailed strategies (from behavioral techniques to advanced approaches like neural networks) enabling them to identify big-picture trends and capture extreme price moves. Unlike many books on market trading, &lt;em&gt;Trading Systems and Methods&lt;/em&gt; takes the approach that, applied the right way, many systems can be successful under different market conditions. It shows you how to identify and evaluate those conditions, and how to apply the strategies. Tools available on the Companion Website allow for valuable hands-on experimentation, so you can enter the market with a sound plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's traders need the confidence to take on risk more than they ever have, thanks to current market conditions and technological advances. A basic understanding of risk management and volatility stabilization must now be replaced by more advanced knowledge. Kaufman recognizes risk acceptance as one of the most important aspects of any trading system, and this &lt;em&gt;Sixth Edition&lt;/em&gt; is accordingly more focused on risk profiling and complex risk modeling, than its predecessors. To make way for this new emphasis, Kaufman has also completely revised the text to be better organized and shares more concise, with to-the-point trading explanations. Busy professionals and international traders will especially appreciate this new text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the competition for trading profits gets tougher, traders need to look for more innovative solutions. This book teaches you not just how to apply various equity and futures investing methods, but how to pick and choose elements from among them to develop a unique strategy that suits your needs. Use the tools in this book to carve out your own niche in the market, and you'll trade smarter and reap greater rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;From the Back Cover&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Perry's book is key in helping to answer the age old question of when to buy and when to sell. A must read for anyone who invests."&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;—Michael Pallitto,&lt;/strong&gt; Financial Advisor &lt;/p&gt;
